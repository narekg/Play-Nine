# Play-Nine
This is a simple React based game app for begginers. <br />No React environment is need for checking it out, just copy-paste the source code to the <a href='https://jscomplete.com/repl/'>JS repl</a> and start playing with it. <br /><br />App is based on the game that was demonstrated in the excellent <a href='https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-js-getting-started'> React.js: Getting Started</a> pluralsight couse by Samer Buna, I've just extended the functionality(added ability to select, deselect items, removed possibility for getting dublicated number of stars on each iteration, etc) and replaced bootstrap with plain flexbox. <br /><br />All code is written by me, although I've followed the best practices given in the tutorial. <br />Feel free to create issues or pull requests.
